## MuZero - DeepMind

According to their developers, the MuZero algorithm "achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without
any knowledge of their underlying dynamics". This lagorithm can learn by itself to make a model able to predict " the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function". This means that basically we (developers) do not need to hand-code any of these aspects of the RL model because this is precisely the algorthms job. 

According to the DeepMind Team, the MuZero implementation framework can be useful in many scenarios such as video compression
